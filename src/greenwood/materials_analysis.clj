(defn local-lindemann-index
  "The Lindemann index effectively measures the degree of translation
  freedom of a molecule and in this sense is similar to the mean square
  displacement (MSD). The Lindemann index measures the average displacement
  of molecules relative to their neighbors, whereas the MSD measures the
  average displacement of a molecule relative to its own position at
  an earlier time. So in principle, just as the magnitude of the MSD can
  distinguish between a solid and liquid, or a liquid and gas, the Lindemann
  index should be able to do the same.

  The boiling point depends on the pressure, but at a given pressure, the
  magnitude of the Lindemann index should still be able to distinguish
  between 'a translationally free - small volume' liquid phase and a
  'translationally free - large volume' gas phase.
  The advantage of using the Lindemann index is that it does not depend as
  much on the size of the simulation system. For a simulation with periodic
  boundary conditions in all three directions, the Lindemann index and MSD
  give similar information, but in the case of a nanoparticle simulation, or
  a simulation of a confined system, the MSD will depend on system dimension
  and not give a clear picture of the molecular motion.
  --Saman Alavi Â· University of British Columbia - Vancouver
  The Lindemann index[1] is a simple measure of thermally driven disorder in
  atoms or molecules. In condensed matter physics a departure from linearity in
  the behaviour of the global Lindemann index or an increase above a threshold
  value related to the spacing between atoms (or micelles, particles, globules,
  etc.) is often taken as the indication that a solid-liquid phase transition
  has taken place.  THIS FORMULATION IS USED FOR NON-PERIODIC SYSTEMS.
  This function outputs a seq containing the lindemann-index for each atom in
